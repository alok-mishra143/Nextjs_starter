# Next.js Starter with Tailwind CSS and Cleark Auth

Welcome to the Next.js Starter repository with Tailwind CSS and Cleark Auth integration. This starter kit is designed to jumpstart your Next.js projects with pre-configured Tailwind CSS for styling and Cleark Auth for authentication, allowing you to focus on building your application right away.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Utilize the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapidly style your components using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.
- **Cleark Auth**: Seamlessly integrate Cleark Auth for authentication in your Next.js application.
- **Shandcn UI**: (Assuming "shandcn ui" is a typo for "Chakra UI") Optionally leverage Chakra UI, a simple, modular and accessible component library for React.
